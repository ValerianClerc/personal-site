Hi! I'm a software developer based in Montreal, and I love building cool things and challenging myself by learning new technologies.

I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) in 2021. I'm moving out to Vancouver to work at [Microsoft](https://mcec.microsoft.ca/).

Check out the [projects](/projects) page for highlights of my favorite projects, and [posts](/posts) for write-ups by me.

Lately, I've been having fun with robotics, and functional programming with Haskell.

Feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:valerian.clerc@gmail.com) whether you have a question, opportunity, or just want to say hi!
